Common Ground - From vision to realisation
=====

## Purpose
This repository holds evolving documents describing the Common Ground vision and all that is necessary for its realisation.

All documents describing architecture, functional and non-functional requirements, way of working, backlogs, use cases, user stories and so on - will be public to achieve maximum transparency.



## Vision

The vision known as *Common Ground* emerged from local municipalities in The Netherlands. With information systems increasingly lagging behind society's demand, Common Ground envisions a radically change for the better, breaking free form the status quo in which innovation and dynamic adaptation of new demands has become nearly impossible.

Seen from the perspective of today's technological state of the art this vision brings nothing radically new, yet in the context of governmental information management it introduces some ambitious goals that will require long term commitment of both politicians and technicians to achieve.

#### From authorization per solution to a federated authorization system
