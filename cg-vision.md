## Vision

The vision known as *Common Ground* emerges from local municipalities in The Netherlands. With information systems increasingly lagging behind society's demand, Common Ground envisions a radical change for the better, breaking free form the status quo in which innovation and dynamic adaptation of new technology has become nearly impossible.

Seen from the perspective of today's technological state of the art this vision brings nothing radically new, yet in the context of governmental information management it introduces some ambitious goals that will require long term commitment of both politicians and technicians to achieve.

#### From silos to layers

In the last couple of decades, governmental organisations collected more and more applications that each support their own purpose, but are not very well equipped to work in conjunction with other applications. Every application can be seen as a silo, containing user interface, business logic and all data necessary to support one or more specific processes. On top of that, the collection of applications did not receive much guidance (Enterprise Architecture) and consists of many styles of software architecture, if any. In a single local municipality one can expect to find hundreds of those application silo's.

The *silo's* need to be broken down and converted to *layers* in order to create an application landscape that is robust and flexible. To roughly describe the desired software architecture, five layers are envisioned in Common Ground:

* Interaction
* Control
* Integration
* Services
* Data
